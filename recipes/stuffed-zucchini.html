            <li>1 pound pork sausage</li>

            <li>1 jar spaghetti sauce</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
           <p>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

           <p>
                Stuff squash with sausage mixture and arrange in a 
                9x13-inch baking pan. Pour spaghetti sauce over the 
                top and cover with aluminum foil.

                Bake in the preheated oven until sausage is browned
