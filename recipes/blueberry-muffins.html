        <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
               This easy blueberry muffin recipe is absolutely 
               delicious. The secret is in not mixing the batter 
               too much: the less you mix, the better the muffins 
               are. You can replace the blueberries with chocolate 
               chips to make an even better muffin.
          </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>0.75 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>0.5 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>0.3 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>0.3 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
           <p>
                Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F 
                (200 degrees C). Grease 8 muffin cups 
                or line with muffin liners.
           </p>
           <p>
                Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and 
                salt together in a large bowl.
           </p>
           <p>
                Pour oil into a small liquid measuring cup.
                Add egg and enough milk to reach the 1-cup 
                mark. Stir until combined. Pour into flour 
                mixture and mix just until batter is combined.
                Fold in blueberries. Set batter aside.
           </p>
           <p>
                Combine sugar, flour, butter, and cinnamon for crumb 
                topping in a small bowl. Mix with a fork until crumbly.
           </p>
           <p>
                Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling right 
                to the top. Sprinkle with crumb topping.
           </p>
           <p>
                Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in 
                the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
